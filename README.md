# Samrudh Jain

Full-stack engineer focused on building reliable systems across React, Node.js, distributed services, and cloud infrastructure. I work fast, design clean architectures, and ship production-ready features without hand-holding. Most of my work sits at the intersection of backend systems, automation, and Web3 integrations.

### What I Do
- Design and build scalable backend services (Node.js, NestJS, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Architect cloud-native deployments on AWS/GCP  
- Develop internal automation, AI-agent workflows, and ops-driven tooling  
- Ship end-to-end products with clear ownership and tight feedback loops  

### Selected Work
- **Onov8** — Distributed microservices for a government onboarding system (NestJS + RabbitMQ), secure doc-processing pipelines, and 20+ production fixes shipped.  
- **SprintBox** — Delivered a complete MVP (backend, DB design, and React integration) in <8 weeks, defining reusable backend patterns.  
- **LogiSetu (Co-founder)** — AI-driven logistics automation prototypes deployed to real operators (workflow orchestration, warehouse aggregation, export docs).  
- **Virr Trading** — Automation tools and a full LMS that streamlined fintech operations.  
- **SST Innovation Lab** — Agri-tech telemetry systems, drone navigation logic, and model-driven distance mapping.

### Projects
- **Meme Battle (Web3):** Smart contracts on Base + GPT scoring engine  
- **Attendance App:** Geo-fenced system used daily by 800+ students  
- **AI Agents (V1/V2):** Autonomous workflow systems for logistics  
- **Fit-Track:** React + Express + PostgreSQL with Cloudflare R2 + AWS Lambda
